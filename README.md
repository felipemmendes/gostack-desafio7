## Features

To complete this challenge, I needed to add the following funcionalities to the app, and pass all tests.

* ``List transactions``: The ``Dashboard`` page should list all transactions from an API response.
* ``Show account balance``: The ``Dashboard`` page should show the account balance from an API response.
* ``Import .csv file``: The``Import`` page should import a .csv file and make a request to create new transactions.
